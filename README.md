Welcome to the ui-sample for neighborhood.com. This sample is a static replica of the top portion of your current site's neighborhood page with an added feature called Top Picks. If you go to the search bar and click on it, you will see the recently viewed results pop up. If you click on Top Picks you will see an additional component appear that displays 3 listing links. These links are also static and will just reload the page, but the top picks component could be a useful asset for displaying additional information that the user may want to quickly access while searching for neighborhoods. 

This sample was built with React, and could easily be updated to be responsive, handle state management with Redux or replace the static data with data grabbed from a RESTful API. I've enjoyed thinking of this feature and would love to discuss other ui component features that could bolster the user experience at neighborhoods.com.

Feel free to take a look at the code and let me know if you have any questions you can direct them to hjmorrow23@gmail.com.
